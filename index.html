                        <h3>Setting</h3>
                        <p>Glamis is set in the broad and fertile lowland valley of <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strathmore,_Angus_and_Perth_%26_Kinross">Strathmore</a>, near <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forfar">Forfar</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_town">county town</a> of 
                        Angus, which lies between the <a target="_blank" href="">Sidlaw Hills</a> to the south and the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grampian_Mountains">Grampian Mountains</a> to the north, 
                        approximately 20 kilometres (12 mi) inland from the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Sea">North Sea</a>. The estate surrounding the castle 
                        covers more than 57 square kilometres (14,000 acres) and, in addition to parks and gardens, 
                        produces several cash crops including lumber and beef. There are two streams running through the 
                        estate, one of them the Glamis Burn. An <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arboretum">arboretum</a> overlooking Glamis Burn features trees from all 
                        over the world, many of them rare and several hundred years old.</p>

                            <h3>History</h3>
                            <p>The vicinity of Glamis Castle has prehistoric traces; for example, a noted intricately carved 
                            <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pictish_stone">Pictish stone</a> known as the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eassie_Stone">Eassie Stone</a> was found in a creek-bed at the nearby village of <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eassie">Eassie</a>.[3]</p>
                            <p>In 1034 <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_II_of_Scotland">Malcolm II</a> was murdered at Glamis,[4] where there was a Royal Hunting Lodge.[2] In 
                            <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Shakespeare">William Shakespeare</a>'s play <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macbeth">Macbeth</a> (1603–06), the eponymous character resides at Glamis Castle, 
                            although the historical <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macbeth,_King_of_Scotland">King Macbeth</a> (d. 1057) had no connection to the castle.</p>
                            <p>By 1372 a castle had been built at Glamis, since in that year it was granted by <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_II_of_Scotland">Robert II</a> to 
                            <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Lyon_(lord_of_Glamis)">Sir John Lyon</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earl_of_Strathmore_and_Kinghorne">Thane of Glamis</a>, husband of the king's daughter. Glamis has remained in the Lyon 
                            (later Bowes-Lyon) family since this time. The castle was rebuilt as an <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-plan_castle">L-plan</a> <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_houses_in_Britain_and_Ireland">tower house</a>   in the 
                            early 15th century.[5]</p>
                            <p>The title <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Glamis">Lord Glamis</a> was created in 1445 for <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Lyon,_1st_Lord_Glamis">Sir Patrick Lyon</a> (1402–1459), grandson of Sir John. 
                            John Lyon, 6th Lord Glamis, married <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janet_Douglas,_Lady_Glamis">Janet Douglas</a>, daughter of the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Douglas,_Master_of_Angus">Master of Angus</a>, at a time when 
                            <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_V_of_Scotland">James V</a>James V was feuding with the Douglases. In December 1528, Janet was accused of treason for bringing 
                            supporters of the Earl of Angus to Edinburgh. She was then charged with poisoning her husband, Lord 
                            Glamis, who had died on 17 September 1528. Eventually, she was accused of witchcraft, and was burned 
                            at the stake at Edinburgh on 17 July 1537. James V subsequently seized Glamis, living there for some time.[2]</p>
                            <p>In 1543, Glamis was returned to <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Lyon,_7th_Lord_Glamis">John Lyon, 7th Lord Glamis</a>. In 1606, <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Lyon,_9th_Lord_Glamis"></a>Patrick Lyon, 9th Lord Glamis, 
                            was created <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earl_of_Kinghorne">Earl of Kinghorn</a>e. He began major works on the castle, commemorated by the inscription 
                            "Built by Patrick, Lord Glamis, and D[ame] Anna Murray" on the central tower.[1] The English architect 
                            <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inigo_Jones">Inigo Jones</a> has traditionally been linked to the redesign of the castle, though <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historic_Scotland">Historic Scotland</a> 
                            consider the King's Master Mason <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Schaw">William Schaw</a> a more likely candidate, due to the traditional Scottish 
                            style of the architecture.[1]</p>
                            <p>During the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_of_England">Commonwealth of England, Scotland, and Ireland</a>, soldiers were garrisoned at Glamis. In 1670, 
                            <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Lyon,_3rd_Earl_of_Strathmore_and_Kinghorne">Patrick Lyon, 3rd Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne</a>, returned to the castle and found it uninhabitable. 
                            Restorations took place until 1689, including the creation of a major <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baroque"></a>Baroque garden.[1][2] <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Bowes,_9th_Earl_of_Strathmore_and_Kinghorne">John Lyon, 9th Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne</a>, succeeded in 1753, and in 1767 he married <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Eleanor_Bowes">Mary Eleanor Bowes</a>, 
                            heiress to a coal-mining fortune. He set about improving the grounds of the castle in the picturesque 
                            style in the 1770s.[1] The south-west wing was rebuilt after a fire in the early 19th century. In the 
                            1920s, a huge fireplace from <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gibside">Gibside</a>, the Bowes-Lyon estate near Gateshead, was removed and placed in 
                            Glamis' Billiard Room. The fireplace displays the coat of arms of the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blakiston_baronets">Blakiston family</a>; Gibside heiress 
                            Elizabeth Blakiston had married <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Bowes_(MP_for_County_Durham)">Sir William Bowes</a>.[5][6] Several interiors, including the Dining Room, 
                            also date from the 18th and 19th centuries.[1]</p>
                            <p>In 1900, <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Elizabeth_Bowes-Lyon">Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon</a>Lady  was born, the youngest daughter of <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Bowes-Lyon,_14th_Earl_of_Strathmore_and_Kinghorne">Claude Bowes-Lyon</a>, 14th Earl of 
                            Strathmore and Kinghorne and his wife, <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cecilia_Bowes-Lyon,_Countess_of_Strathmore_and_Kinghorne">Cecilia</a> (née Cavendish-Bentinck). She spent much of her childhood 
                            at Glamis, which was used during the First World War as a military hospital.[1] She was particularly 
                            instrumental in organising the rescue of the castle's contents during a serious fire on 16 September 1916.[
                            7] On 26 April 1923 she <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wedding_of_Prince_Albert,_Duke_of_York,_and_Lady_Elizabeth_Bowes-Lyon">married</a> <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Albert,_Duke_of_York">Prince Albert, Duke of York</a> , second son of <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_V">George V</a>, at Westminster Abbey.

                            <p>Since 1987, an illustration of the castle has featured on the reverse side of <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banknotes_of_the_pound_sterling">ten pound notes</a> issued by

                        <h3>Legends and Tales</h3>
                        <h4>The Monster of Glamis</h4>
                        <p>The most famous legend connected with the castle is that of the Monster of Glamis, a hideously deformed child 
                        born to the family. Some accounts came from singer and composer <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia_Gabriel">Virginia Gabriel</a> who stayed at the castle in 
                        1870.[9] In the story, the monster was kept in the castle all his life and his suite of rooms bricked up after 
                        his death.[10][11][12][13] Another monster is supposed to have dwelt in Loch Calder near the castle.[citation needed]</p>
                        <p>An alternative version of the legend is that to every generation of the family a vampire child is born and 
                        is walled up in that room.[11]</p>
                        <p>There is an old story that guests staying at Glamis once hung towels from the windows of every room in a bid to 
                        find the bricked-up suite of the monster. When they looked at it from outside, several windows were apparently towel-less.[11]</p>
                        <p>The legend of the monster may have been inspired by the true story of the Ogilvies.[11][14][15]</p>

                        <h4>Earl Beardie</h4>
                        <p>A legend tells of the 15th-century "Earl Beardie," who has been identified with both Alexander Lyon, 2nd Lord 
                        Glamis (died 1486),[10] and with <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Lindsay,_4th_Earl_of_Crawford">Alexander Lindsay, 4th Earl of Crawford</a> (died 1453).[16] Several versions exist, 
                        but they all involve "Earl Beardie" playing cards. However, it was the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabbath_in_Christianity">sabbath</a>sabbath, and either his hosts refused to 
                        play, or a servant advised him to stop. Lord Beardie became so furious that he claimed that he would play until 
                        doomsday, or with the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devil">Devil</a> himself, depending on the version. A stranger then appears at the castle and joins Lord 
                        Beardie in a game of cards. The stranger is identified with the Devil, who takes Earl Beardie's <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soul_(spirit)">soul</a> and, in some 
                        versions, condemns the Earl to play cards until doomsday.[10][17]</p>

                        <h4>Other Traditions</h4>
                        <p>According to the official website for Glamis Castle, in 1034, <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_II_of_Scotland">Malcolm II</a> was mortally wounded in a nearby battle 
                        and taken to a Royal Hunting Lodge, which sat at the site of the present castle, where he died.</p>
                        <p>The late Sir <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Bowes-Lyon">David Bowes-Lyon</a>, while taking a late stroll on the lawn after dinner, reportedly saw a girl gripping 
                        the bars of a castle window and staring distractedly into the night. He was about to speak to her when she 
                        abruptly disappeared, as if someone had torn her away from the window.[citation needed]</p>

                        <h3>Description</h3>
                        <p>The towers in front of the castle each measure 7 metres (23 ft) in diameter and are about 4 metres (13 ft) high, 
                        each having a modern parapet. The walls are 1 metre (3 ft 3 in) thick.[5]</p>
                        <p>There is a small chapel within the castle with seating for 46 people. The story given to visitors by castle tour 
                        guides states that one seat in the chapel is always reserved for the "White Lady" (supposedly a ghost which inhabits 
                        the castle), thought to be <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janet,_Lady_Glamis">Janet Douglas, Lady Glamis</a>. According to the guides, the chapel is still used regularly 
                        for family functions, but no one is allowed to sit in that seat.[citation needed]</p>
